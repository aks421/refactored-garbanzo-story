The potato sat gloomily on the countertop. He had been dreading this day,
but his time had come. He fixated on the hand with a knife in its grasp. Don't
show fear, he told himself. After all, fear was common among lesser foods,
such as spinach and carrots, but would be unbecoming for one of his status. 
 He was the mightiest food in this kitchen. The knife was now raised over him,
ready to strike. In this last moment, he hoped the human holding the knife
would enjoy his taste. Then, with a swish, the knife ended this story.

At this moment, a gloomy carrot looked on. He is scared, no, super scared. 
He knew that his time was getting shorter because the mightiest potato met 
his doom. He bgan thinking. His thoughts, mainly on fear, contained thoughts 
on death, the afterlife, and the death of the potato. His thoughts led to 
one thought, he is not going to be scared at the end of his story. He was not
going to be a coward.
