The potato sat gloomily on the countertop. He had been dreading this day,
but his time had come. He fixated on the hand with a knife in its grasp. Don't
show fear, he told himself. After all, fear was common among lesser foods,
such as spinach and carrots, but would be unbecoming for one of his status. 
 He was the mightiest food in this kitchen. The knife was now raised over him,
ready to strike. In this last moment, he hoped the human holding the knife
would enjoy his taste. Then, with a swish, the knife ended this story.

But wait, it is not quite over! The potato swiftly threw a chunk of himself at the knife wielder.

The chunk hit the knife wielder straight in the eye. Screaming, the knife wielder realized that he had become blind! Now he can't cut food properly!
